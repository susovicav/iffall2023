        A Minecraft parody of "Viva La Vida" (Coldplay)

    <p>I used to rule the world<br>
        Chunks would load when I gave the word<br>
        Now every night I go stow away<br>
        Hide from the mobs I used to slay</p>
        
        <p>They once were terrified<br>
        Every time I looked into their eyes<br>
        Villagers would cheer my way<br>
        For a hero I was, that's what they'd say</p>
        
        <p>One minute we had it all<br>
        Next our world began to fall<br>
        Away from all that it had once become<br>
        They all cried for my help, but I stood there numb</p>
        
        <p>I gaze off into the boundless skyline<br>
        Note block choirs playing in the sunshine<br>
        Turn around, pick up my sword and wield<br>
        The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield<br>
        And hope one day that this chaos and<br>
        Destruction turns for the better<br>
        Never a bow in hand<br>
        That was when I ruled the land</p>
        
        <p>It was the creepers and the skeletons<br>
        Blew down the doors and boxed us in<br>
        Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light<br>
        I tried all that I could to stay and fight</p>
        
        <p>As the undead roamed the street<br>
        Families broken at my feet<br>
        Life itself suspended by a thread<br>
        Oh, why was it that I wasn't dead?</p>
        
        <p>
        I gaze off into the boundless skyline<br>
        Note block choirs playing in the sunshine<br>
        Turn around, pick up my sword and wield<br>
        The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield<br>
        If this battle should leave me slain<br>
        I know Herobrine will call my name<br>
        Better to take a stand<br>
        That was when I ruled the land</p>

        <p>
            I gaze off into the boundless skyline<br>
            Note block choirs playing in the sunshine<br>
            Turn around, pick up my sword and wield<br>
            The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield<br>
            If this battle should leave me slain<br>
            I know Herobrine will call my name<br>
            Better to take a stand<br>
            That was when I ruled the land</p>
