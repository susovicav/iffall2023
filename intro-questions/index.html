        </h1>
        <ol style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; color:rgb(190, 218, 190)">
        <li><p style="max-width: 700px;color: darkslategray;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Hi! My name is Veronica Susovica and I am currently a junior majoring in design.</p> </li>
        <li><p style="max-width: 700px;color: darkslategray;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif">(A little bit of my background) I like working primarily with digital illustration,
            so this will be very new to me. What prompted me to take this class is that I wanted
            to learn how to make websites, especially since I want to make my own portfolio without
            relying on square space or wix and it would be nice to have something custom to me.
            But I also think it is a valuable skill to have in this golden age of computers.</p></li>
        <li> <p style="max-width: 700px;color: darkslategray;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif"> I have extremely minimal experience with HTML/CSS/JS. 
            I briefly worked with HTML in Typography last spring, but I honestly wouldn't count that 
            as I didn't really know what I was doing. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p style="max-width: 700px;color: darkslategray;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif"> One thing I hope I learn in this class is to hopefully be more comfortable/confident
              using HTML/CSS so that, in turn, I can experiment making my own websites. </p></li>
        <li><p style="max-width: 700px;color: darkslategray;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif">One way I anticipate it will be different designing for a screen 
            rather than paper is the disconnect. When you use a pencil or 
            stylus, you're directly marking the idea onto a blank sheet: idea -> result. 
            However, it seems that with HTML, for example, it's more like idea -> tags -> result. So, the 
            tags create that disconnect. It almost reminds me of those "etch a sketch" tablets, 
            where you can't draw on the tablet, but you have to rely on the little wheels to be able to draw.</p> </li>

            <p style="max-width: 700px;color: darkslategray;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif">After playing the game itself, I noticed the visual language used in the website
                 matches that of the game design. I also love the little pop-up animations and the subtle scrolling texture animation 
                 in the background. It has a playful flow which suits the content and it layers images very well.

            <p style="max-width: 700px;color: darkslategray;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif">It does its job as a restaraunt website. I can find the menu and categories of food
            easily. When I open the page, I am immediatley given the choices of dining methods. The labels are clear and bold and the despcriptions are more quiet which indicates there's a clear hierarchy of
             information in place. Moreover, there is a good organization of thumbnails which helps make navigation easier.

            <p style="max-width: 700px;color: darkslategray;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif"> This website is very interactive for a simple "business card"/portfolio website.
                 It goes beyond the standard "this is me and what I have done" and it makes it fun for the visitor as well. The animations are clean 
                 and I think the addition of sound effects are fun. The interactive gadgets run smoothly and everything is well put together.
