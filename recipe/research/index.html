    Tiramisù<br>
    By Alison Roman
</p>

<p>
    Done correctly, a classic tiramisù can be transcendent. A creamy dessert of espresso-soaked ladyfingers surrounded by lightly sweetened whipped cream and a rich mascarpone, tiramisù relies heavily on the quality of its ingredients. If you don’t have a barista setup at home, pick up the espresso at a local coffee shop, or use strongly brewed coffee. As for the ladyfingers, make your own or buy them, but keep in mind that store-bought varieties can range from soft and spongy (like angel food cake) to hard and crunchy (like biscotti). Both kinds will work here, but if you're using the softer variety, stick to a light brushing of espresso, instead of a deep dip.

    25 minutes, plus chilling<br>


    INGREDIENTS<br>
    Yield:<br>
    6 to 8 servings<br>
    FOR THE CREAM<br>
    
    4large egg yolks<br>
    ½cup/100 grams granulated sugar, divided<br>
    ¾cup heavy cream<br>
    1cup/227 grams mascarpone (8 ounces)<br>
    FOR THE ASSEMBLY<br>
    
    1¾cups good espresso or very strong coffee<br>
    2tablespoons rum or cognac<br>
    2tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
    About 24 ladyfingers (from one 7-ounce/200-gram package)<br>
    1 to 2ounces bittersweet chocolate, for shaving (optional)
</p>

<p>
    Step 1<br>
    Prepare the cream: Using an electric mixer in a large bowl, whip together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Set aside.<br>
    Step 2<br>
    In a medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it creates soft peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.<br>
    Step 3<br>
    For the assembly, combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.<br>
    Step 4<br>
    Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.<br>
    Step 5<br>
    Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture -- they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve got an even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any obvious gaps (a little space in between is O.K.). Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer. Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.<br>
    Step 6<br>
    Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder.<br>
    Step 7<br>
    Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (if you can wait 24 hours, all the better). Top with shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired, then slice or scoop to serve.<br>

    I think it's a brilliant idea to have the ingredients listed as images (alongside a text-list of course). I also thought it was interesting that the steps weren't in a
     typical vertical scroll layout but a 2x2 grid layout instead; a picture with a simple description of the step.

I like the split column in this website in addition to the fact that the text is on the smaller side so the user has an overview of the entire recipe at once. 
It's easier to read too since the ingredients are separated from the steps by background color. The ingredients fall into the background with the beige while the steps stand out in the white.

The horizontal scroll of images depicting needed materials for the recipe is such a cute idea! However, 
I am finding that the vertical scroll of steps (which this website uses) isn't the most efficent layout for recipes. When you're baking/cooking, you're already preoccupied with the task itself
and going back to scroll and find where you are on the page is a bit annoying (speaking from experience).

 I like the simplicity of this one, it's a lot easier to understand what is being communicated. 
 I could keep in mind to keep things simple when I design my website. 
The introductory animation is also a nice touch.

    There might be a little too much going on. But I like how the design choices mirror the product;
    how the colorful animated letters mimic the energy of the drink. 
    Maybe I could somehow incorporate the colors of tiramisu into the color palette of the website page.

     I think this website is a happy balance of the two prior ones. It's not too boring but it's not overwhelming. 
     It has a fun color pallete and it's not just "scroll scroll scroll" since the rows of boxes break up the 
     monotony of a vertical scroll. Incorporating some clickable boxes into my recipe website would be interesting.
